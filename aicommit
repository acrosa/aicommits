Analyze the following list of commit messages and describe their common stylistic features in terms of tone, length, structure, and use of language:

Provide a concise description of the style used in these commit messages. Be specific about length, tone (e.g., imperative), and any recurring patterns. Do NOT include any content from the commit messages themselves.

Based on the style description extracted from previous commit messages: $style_description

1. Analyze the provided diff and generate a new commit message based solely on its content.
2. Mimic the style characteristics described above (length, tone, structure) without using any content from the previous commit messages.
3. Use action verbs (e.g., 'updated', 'refactored', 'added') and be concise in describing the changes.
4. **Output ONLY the commit message itself.** Do not include any explanations, introductions, formatting, or extra text.
